# ðŸš€ FYP Quick Start Guide

## **Immediate Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Download & Setup (15 minutes)**
```bash
# 1. Download/clone this project to your computer
# 2. Open terminal in the project folder

# Install all dependencies
npm run install-all

# This installs both server and client dependencies
```

### **Step 2: Database Setup (10 minutes)**

**Option A: MongoDB Atlas (Recommended - Free & Easy)**
1. Go to [mongodb.com/atlas](https://mongodb.com/atlas)
2. Create free account
3. Create new cluster (free tier)
4. Get connection string
5. Update `server/.env` file:
```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/fyp_hospital_system
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secure_jwt_secret_key_here
PORT=5000
```

**Option B: Local MongoDB**
```bash
# Install MongoDB locally, then:
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/fyp_hospital_system
```

### **Step 3: Run the Application (2 minutes)**
```bash
# Start both server and client
npm run dev

# Or run separately:
# Terminal 1: npm run server
# Terminal 2: npm run client
```

**Access your application:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000

### **Step 4: Test the System (5 minutes)**
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Register as a patient
3. Register as a doctor (different email)
4. Login with patient account
5. Try to book an appointment
6. Login with doctor account
7. View appointments
